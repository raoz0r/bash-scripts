# ðŸ“‚ Scripts Collection

This repository is my personal backup of scripts.  
Bash, Python, or whatever I ended up writing and don't feel like throwing away (yet).

Some scripts were useful once, some might still be.  
Most are here because I didnâ€™t want to forget them, or maybe I thought theyâ€™d be useful later (they probably wonâ€™t).
