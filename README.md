# üóÑÔ∏è Bash Scripts Collection

This repository is nothing more (and nothing less) than a personal dump of bash scripts I've written, used, or abandoned over time.

They do things that made sense to me at the moment I wrote them. Some are backups, some are automation helpers, others are random one-liners promoted to the dignity of a `.sh` file.

There is no order. No promises of quality. No workflow explanations.

## üí° Use at Your Own Curiosity

If you see something useful, feel free to grab it, fork it, or rewrite it better.

These scripts are here mostly for my own sake, but if they end up saving you a few keystrokes or sparking an idea, even better.

## License

No license. Use at your own risk and joy.
